## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to get more practice using flexbox. I experimented some more with using responsive typography like clamp and min/max.  They took a while to work out but they really do work wonders and saved me from filling my code with media queries.   

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I hope I succeeded in vertically centering contents in a container as I'm not sure if my card responds well with very large screens.  I need more practice with flexbox and grid and perhaps start using CSS pre-processors.
